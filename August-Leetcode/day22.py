Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
1 <= rects.length <= 100
pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
pick is called at most 10000 times.
